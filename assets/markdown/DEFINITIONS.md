## Definitions

The following definitions are used throughout the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/text_indexing/latest/):
* `corpus`- the collection of `documents` for which an `index` is maintained.
* `character filter` - filters characters from text in preparation of tokenization.  
* `dictionary` - is a hash of `terms` (`vocabulary`) to the frequency of occurence in the `corpus` documents.
* `document` - a record in the `corpus`, that has a unique identifier (`docId`) in the `corpus`'s primary key and that contains one or more text fields that are indexed.
* `document frequency (dFt)` is number of documents in the `corpus` that contain a term.
- `Flesch reading ease score` - a readibility measure calculated from  sentence length and word length on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document ([Wikipedia(6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)).
- `Flesch-Kincaid grade level` - a readibility measure relative to U.S. school grade level.  It is also calculated from sentence length and word length ([Wikipedia(6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)).
* `index` - an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) used to look up `document` references from the `corpus` against a `vocabulary` of `terms`. 
* `index-elimination` - selecting a subset of the entries in an index where the `term` is in the collection of `terms` in a search phrase.
* `inverse document frequency` or `iDft` is equal to log (N / `dft`), where N is the total number of terms in the index. The `IdFt` of a rare term is high, whereas the [IdFt] of a frequent term is likely to be low.
* `Jaccard index` measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)).
* `JSON` is an acronym for `"Java Script Object Notation"`, a common format for persisting data.
* `k-gram` - a sequence of (any) k consecutive characters from a `term`. A `k-gram` can start with "$", denoting the start of the term, and end with "$", denoting the end of the term. The 3-grams for "castle" are { $ca, cas, ast, stl, tle, le$ }.
* `lemmatizer` - lemmatisation (or lemmatization) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation)).
* `postings` - a separate index that records which `documents` the `vocabulary` occurs in.  In a positional `index`, the postings also records the positions of each `term` in the `text` to create a positional inverted `index`.
* `postings list` - a record of the positions of a `term` in a `document`. A position of a `term` refers to the index of the `term` in an array that contains all the `terms` in the `text`. In a zoned `index`, the `postings lists` records the positions of each `term` in the `text` a `zone`.
* `term` - a word or phrase that is indexed from the `corpus`. The `term` may differ from the actual word used in the corpus depending on the `tokenizer` used.
* `term filter` - filters unwanted terms from a collection of terms (e.g. stopwords), breaks compound terms into separate terms and / or manipulates terms by invoking a `stemmer` and / or `lemmatizer`.
* `stemmer` -  stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming)).
* `stopwords` - common words in a language that are excluded from indexing.
* `term frequency (Ft)` is the frequency of a `term` in an index or indexed object.
* `term position` is the zero-based index of a `term` in an ordered array of `terms` tokenized from the `corpus`.
* `text` - the indexable content of a `document`.
* `token` - representation of a `term` in a text source returned by a `tokenizer`. The token may include information about the `term` such as its position(s) (`term position`) in the text or frequency of occurrence (`term frequency`).
* `token filter` - returns a subset of `tokens` from the tokenizer output.
* `tokenizer` - a function that returns a collection of `token`s from `text`, after applying a character filter, `term` filter, [stemmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and / or [lemmatizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation).
* `vocabulary` - the collection of `terms` indexed from the `corpus`.
* `zone` is the field or zone of a document that a term occurs in, used for parametric indexes or where scoring and ranking of search results attribute a higher score to documents that contain a term in a specific zone (e.g. the title rather that the body of a document).
